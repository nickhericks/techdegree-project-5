## Project objective

This project required me to build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They are in need of a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

I used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and used that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

I requested a JSON object from the API and parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name opens a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.

## Techniques and concepts

<!-- - Object-Oriented Programming
- JavaScript classes
- Array iteration methods
- CSS variables -->

## Additional features

In addition to completing the basic requirements for this techdegree project, I also added additional features including:

<!-- - [x] Added functionality allowing players to use physical keyboard (instead of just the on-screen keyboard)
- [x] Personalized CSS styling (colors, fonts, etc.) -->

## Code example

<!-- An example of one of the JavaScript object methods in this project:

```javascript
/**
* Reveals the letter(s) on the board that matches the player's selection
* @param (string) letter - Letter to display
*/
showMatchedLetter(letter) {
  // Find all elements with class of letter
  let matchedLetters = document.querySelectorAll('.' + letter);

  // Add class of 'show' to those elements
  matchedLetters.forEach( match => match.classList.add('show') );
}
``` -->
