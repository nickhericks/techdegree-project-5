## Project objective

This project required me to build an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They are in need of a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

I used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random ‚Äúemployees,‚Äù and used that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

I requested a JSON object from the API and parsed the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee‚Äôs image or name opens a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee‚Äôs birthday and address.

## Techniques and concepts

- AJAX (Fetch request)
- Third-party API
- JSON objects
- Array iteration methods

## Additional features

In addition to completing the basic requirements for this techdegree project, I also added additional features including:

- [x] Added live search filtering for employee cards on the page
- [x] Added 'Prev' and 'Next' buttons for navigating cards within modal
- [x] Personalized CSS styling (colors, fonts, etc.)

## Code example

This lesson was all about AJAX, so it seems fitting to show the fetch request used:

```javascript
// Request data for 12 random users from the Random User Generator API
fetch('https://randomuser.me/api/?results=12&nat=us')
	.then(response => response.json())
	.then(data => displayEmployees(data.results));
```
